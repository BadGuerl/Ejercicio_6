    <p>Um, I'm happy you're home. Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon? We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers. Why’s he gotta kick the door? Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one?No... no El, you're not the monster. You saved me. Do you understand? You saved me. This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone. It’s finger-lickin’ good. Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.</p>

    <p class="miparrafo">Let’s burn that lab to the ground. She shut one door! With her mind! Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. I need my paddles! Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.You’re going to be home by 8, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something. That sounds like a nice night. It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more.</p>

We all want things. He’s a sensitive kid. Lonnie used to say he was queer. Called him a fag. Is he? He’s missing, is what he is!Mistakes have been made. Oh... candy, leftovers, Eggo's... she really likes Eggo's. Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. Why’s he gotta kick the door? Friends don't lie. It’s finger-lickin’ good. Bitchin' Don’t take it so personally, okay? I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority. Mistakes have been made.You are such a nerd. No wonder you only hang out with boys. You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. Don’t take it so personally, okay? I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority.
